# Overview

Table Explorer is a small (toy) tool that allows you to visualize a database's schema in a web browser. T he schema is presented using boxes and lines generated by plantuml.

While similar to the output of (and inspired by) https://github.com/achiku/planter, Table Explorer offers more dynamic functionality, making it particularly useful for drilling into large databases with many tables and constraints.

# How to Use

To run Table Explorer, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

$ clojure src/web_explorer

Then, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

# Demo

# Future Work

Currently, Table Explorer assumes that there is only one user accessing the web application. However, this could be problematic if you were to share the URL with teammates, as they would all be logged into the same session.
